0.0: Initial three-liner, set gamma to 0.6, run minecraft, put gamma back.
0.1: wrap things a bit
0.2: add in switches -launcher, -server181
0.3: Add functions for help, RunMe, change switches to short form -s/-l
0.4: put in host detection, so CRT outputs get detected on a per-host basis.
0.5: Add in -g (gamma) switch, the -d (default) switch, and do switch parsing. Some of this came from RfcShow.
0.6: Add in function to find current gamma setting, needs work
0.7: Got rid of GetGamma, as it ended up as a one-liner.
0.8: Possible reinstatement as FetchGamma/GammaExit wrappers around $CMD
0.9: Split off gamma setting into its own routine. Should we getopt this program?
0.10: adding a -t (tiny) switch (takes up less memory) and an -e (enormous)
switch. Also tweaked RunMe to RunMC
0.11: reset gamma somewhat so it only fires up if we specify a gamma 
0.12: Tidied up comments, commented out a host-specific section
0.13: Initial try at hacking in server support, change the s parameter to accept a filename
    : This would (of course) fail in the case of an empty -g AND -s (whether empty or not)
    : or vice versa: empty -s with -g parameter.
    : Other problems apply if I specify -s at all, I won't need -l or -g anyhow
0.14: I need to add a correction for gamma at exit of mc.
0.15: Added another launcher to the list of launchers I can execute (SKMCLauncher, by sk89q)
    : added help line for SKMC, tweaked help to say where launchers needed to be)
0.16: added -m option to select which monitor I want gamma raised on.
    : Only problem with this, is it's often different from the monitor I need to correct refresh on.
0.16a: added lines to Help describing -c
0.16b: changed -c to -r (refreshrate)
0.17: added an array to populate ${GETOPTS} with, so I can keep Help() and ParseOpts() in sync.
    : ParseOpts isn't made yet.
0.18: Complete rewrite of options parsing. Well on the way to being actually FINISHED!
    : GammaExit renamed as ResetGamma, I should rename RefreshExit too.
0.19: All done, I hope. One buglet found so far, order of options matters for -m and -g
    : Now executing SetGamma from RunMC. Only the one bugette left, skmclauncher exits and relaunches,
    : so the ResetGamma happens when it shouldn't happen until the script ends. Refresh rate's not getting reset.
0.20: Fixed the order of -g/-m so it doesn't matter.
    : realised that BOTH monitors are getting their refresh rate resynched to "Preferred"
    : In addition, if I choose to reset monitors independently, I'm going to have an interesting problem separating
    : their framerates and gammas from each other. I've also discovered a "brightness" setting.
0.21: Rejiggered three of the switches so I can reuse their lowercase variants as separate switches
    : Replaced MYVAR with ONECMD, added Bright_ functions and a switch. Added -? handling.
    : Thought of something. SKMCLauncher does its own memory handling, so I should ignore -BET if I have -o
0.22: Provided a OSS switch (-O), which provides $CMDRUN as "padsp java". Will it propagate past launchers? Don't know.
0.23: Add proper NEW server support. Consolidate on .minecraft/server as the new home.
0.24: Implement the xrandr as one command, not separate commands.
0.25: Added in the fetchminecraft.sh script whole.
0.26: Added rudimentary MinecraftLauncher support... it just launches ML, nothing else.
0.27: Added stanza to FetchMinecraft to grab a default launcher, also commented future code for skmc and digiex.
0.28: Also added MagicLauncher (stubbed at the moment) and enabled download of skmclauncher's snapshot build
    : in addition, with feedback from keeperfx, decided to tiff all the launchers into ${MCBase}/bin/some-launcher.jar
0.29: added help to -f switch
0.30: added digiex and MultiMC (for Linux), preliminary work for -l (launcher) switch.
0.31: padded out support for change to -l
0.32: added bukkit to the list of available downloads
0.33: added a switch to suspend pulseaudio
0.34: Added _ to the patterns to grep for on -f
0.35: Reworked the Helps for -l and -f to cough up parameters on one line
0.36: Add FTB to list of -l and -f
0.37: Slotted in MVC, put ftb into FOA and LOA so help works.
0.38: Add in the Technic launcher to FetchMinecraft and Launch, also caught typos.
    : incidentally, are LaunchHelpOpts or FetchHelpOpts being used any more?
0.39: Rewrote Launcher()
0.40: Added TerraFirmaCraft (temporary at this stage, it wants to be included in FTB)
0.41: Small patch as Terrafirmacraft launcher is now supplied as a zip
0.42: Added specific directories to change to before starting up
Changelog stripped out of the main file, created as a separate file

0.43: Added in development version of Mojang's launcher.
0.44: Made 1Gb maximum mandatory in 32-bit. Most people can't access more than
      about 1.5Gb contiguously anyhow, apparently.
0.45: Finally added code to fetch versions 1.5.2 and 13w16a onwards, as the location to
      fetch them from has changed.
0.46: Corrected some comments, added json to the downloads. Whether I grab the
      lwjgl as well, is .... problematic. I haven't decided yet.
0.47: Modified FetchMinecraft to download full versions up to 1.9.9 as well as
      snapshots, corrected SetMultiMC to SetMultiLauncher
0.48: Tweaked FetchMinecraft so it'll back up the current version of
      SKMCLauncher, I need to do the same for other launchers. I've also
	  made a note that devlauncher is now the main launcher.
0.49: Altered download link for default launcher so it grabs the new one. I've
      disabled the devlauncher in FetchMinecraft.
