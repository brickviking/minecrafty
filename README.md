==========

This is a bash script for launching minecraft's launchers, downloading most of the available versions of minecraft, or even downloading the latest available bukkit. It does not replace these launchers, merely aids in launching them.
In addition, it provides for the ability to change the screen brightness or gamma, and change the amount of memory assigned to run each launcher.
Currently, it needs xrandr, wget and a couple of other utilities commonly found in a linux distribution. There's nothing to stop this from being used under other operating systems, but be aware that this script uses bash. Not dash, bash.
