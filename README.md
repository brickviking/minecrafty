==========

This is the one-stop script for starting Minecraft. This isn't a replacement for current
launchers, it's more a tool to help out with starting them up.

Features:
* Download commonly available launchers
  * Default launcher (minecraft.net)
  * SKMCLauncher (sk89q.com)
  * Digiex (somewhat obsolete and not kept up to date)
  * MagicLauncher
  * MultiMC
  * FeedTheBeast
  * Craftland
  * Technic
  * Minecraft Version Changer (TunkDesign)
* Download available release and snapshot versions of the minecraft client and server
* Execute any installed minecraft launcher, even the default one
  * Allocate memory
  * Change screen brightness/gamma
* Reset refresh rate on monitors after minecraft finishes
* Downloads the latest bukkit Recommended Build
* Starts a selected server

Requirements:
* A paid account for minecraft. Unpaid won't work, or at best you will have demo.
* Any version of Linux with bash 4 (FreeBSD may work, but only if you have bash 4 installed)
* xrandr (available in most Linuxes)
* wget (to fetch files)
* Java (either OpenJDK, Oracle JDK or equivalents)
* Other minecraft requirements (decent video card, recent machine, enough memory)

Who this is for:
* People who use modified jars
* People who use non-standard launchers
* People who wish to tweak how minecraft starts up
* Dual monitor setups where the second screen gets its refresh rate reset every time
  minecraft quits.
* People who want a single file to start whatever variant of minecraft they have,
  whether client or server.
* People who are reasonably comfortable with using a commandline. This program
  works well enough from .desktop files, but then you don't see any text information.

Who this is NOT for:
* People with no computer experience, who just want to run minecraft without
  any changes, additions or hassles. If the base jar does what you want, then
  this script is not for you.
* People trying to run minecraft without having paid for it. This script
  will not help you. Minecraft is not overly expensive in comparison to some
  other games, and is most definitely worth it.
