Minecraft
=========

•This is the one-stop script for starting Minecraft. This isn’t a replacement for current launchers, it’s more a tool to help out with starting them up.

Features
--------

-   Download commonly available launchers:

    -   Default java launcher for Linux (minecraft.net)

    -   ATL

    -   FeedTheBeast

    -   MagicLauncher

    -   MultiMC

    -   Technic

-   Download available release and snapshot versions of the Minecraft java client

-   Execute any installed Minecraft java-powered launcher, even the default one

    -   Allocate memory for the launcher

    -   Change screen brightness/gamma/resolution

    -   Send output to a logfile

-   Reset refresh rate on monitors after Minecraft finishes

-   Starts a selected installed server

### Recently removed launchers

These launchers have all been removed from minecrafty because they’re either obsolete or in some cases, have been removed by their authors.

-   Aether Launcher (superceded by Aether development version)

-   Craftland (unknown)

-   Digiex (obsolete and not kept up to date)

-   Minecraft Version Changer (TunkDesign) (obsolete, though still available)

-   SKMCLauncher (sk89q.com, obsolete)

-   Download of the latest bukkit Recommended Build (DCMA issues)

Requirements
------------

-   A paid account for Minecraft. Unpaid won’t work, or at best you will have demo.

-   One or more of the Minecraft launchers referred to in the list above.

-   Linux running in graphical (Xorg) mode with 3-D acceleration. Minecraft won’t work otherwise.

-   Any version of Linux with bash 4 (FreeBSD may work, but only if you have bash 4 installed.) This has NOT been tested with cygwin, as Windows has its own launcher.

-   xrandr (available in most Linuxes.)

-   awk (gawk should be available in Linux by default.)

-   wget (to fetch files.)

-   Java 8 (either OpenJDK, Oracle JDK or equivalents.)

-   Other Minecraft requirements (decent video card, recent machine, enough memory.)

-   Some terminal, to run this script and see its output. Not absolutely mandatory, but you’ll thank me if something goes wrong and you can see it.

Who this is for
---------------

-   People who use modified jars.

-   People who use non-standard launchers like FTB or Technic.

-   People who wish to tweak how Minecraft starts up.

-   Dual/multi-monitor setups where the second screen gets its refresh rate reset every time Minecraft quits.

-   People who want a single file to start whatever variant of Minecraft they have, whether client or server.

-   People who are reasonably comfortable with using a commandline. This program works well enough from .desktop files, but then you don’t see any text information.

Who this is NOT for
-------------------

-   People with no computer experience, who just want to run Minecraft without any changes, additions or hassles. If the base launcher does what you want, then this script is not for you.

-   People using the new-format java-less launcher. These usually have a version number of 2.00.1009 or greater. Minecrafty won’t start this one without some help, and at least on Linux, the new launcher isn’t officially supported.

-   People trying to run Minecraft without having paid for it. This script will not help you. Minecraft is not overly expensive in comparison to some other games, and is most definitely worth it.
